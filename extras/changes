Is the calculator imported or did one of us build it?

We should use a calculator with more advanced features such as exponents, trigonometric functions, and more.

tasks.html

We should add a feature where students can write notes for each task such as class, time due, and more.

This might be complicated, but we could add a notification bar that gives a reminder for all of your tasks based on when they are due.

index.html

We should make results appear within the search engine to simplify user navigation.

This might be complicated, but we could make a custom search engine for specific things. 

Ex. We could have a search engine that pulls results only from school-approved research databases.

Ex. We could have a search engine that only goes to government-approved websites.

style.css

Countless changes need to be made to the style to make it friendly for schools and students to use. We should add a style.css file in the code.

These changes include adding more themes making it more colorful, including our logo, etc. This is more creativity than a specific change that needs to be made.
